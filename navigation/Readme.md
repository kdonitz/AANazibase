#Navigation
------
It looks like as far as charts go NOAA doesn't have anything outside Vahsel Bay (and only as an electronic chart.) I think we should take the most common route and then follow the coast to get to our destination but I have no experience with the arctic. 
One up side to this is that will be meeting in Argentina which means the coast you're on (in North America) doesn't matter.
